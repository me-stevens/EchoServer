# Echo Server

A program that speaks to the console. 

To test it, a spy class is created to mock the behaviour of a console. The spy and the console classes implement a `Console` interface with the methods `read()` and `write(message)`.


## To run the tests

Open the project in IntelliJ, right click any file whose name ends with "Test" and choose "Run".


## To run the program
